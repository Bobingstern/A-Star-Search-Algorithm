# A-Star-Search-Algorithm
A* Search Algorithm visualized with p5js 

Here is the [demo ](https://bobingstern.github.io/A-Star-Search-Algorithm/AStar/index.html)

Here is the second [visualization](https://bobingstern.github.io/A-Star-Search-Algorithm/AStar-Vis2/index.html)

Here is the optimized [visualization](https://bobingstern.github.io/A-Star-Search-Algorithm/AStar-Optimized/index.html)

Here is the optimized second [visualization](https://bobingstern.github.io/A-Star-Search-Algorithm/AStar-Optimized_Vis2/index.html)

For large scale grids make sure to use the optimzed version.

# Controls:

Generate Random Maze: Space

Place block: Left Click

Run Algorithm: Enter

Erase Block: Backspace

Move Start Point (Green Box): S

Move End Point (Red Box): E


The optimized version has an auto maze feture that you can use by pressing the left shift key but is still under development and will usually never have have a path to the end so you will have to erase some blocks to make one
